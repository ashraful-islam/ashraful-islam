# Hello, I am Ashraful Islam!

Originally from beautiful south Asian country [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh) üáßüá©, I am currently living in the beautiful port city [Hamburg](https://hamburg.de) in Germany üá©üá™.

Completing my B.Sc. in [Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://eee.uiu.ac.bd/),
I moved to Germany in 2015 to pursue my M.Sc. [Digital Engineering](https://www.ovgu.de/Digital_Engineering_master-path-37420,39794,21190.html).

From 2016 to early 2022, I have worked as a Software Engineer for:
- [E-Farm GmbH](https://e-farm.com/en/)
- [Str√∂er SE & Co. KGaA](https://www.stroeer.de/en/about-us/)

Since early 2022, I am a Software Engineer at [LG-LHT Passenger Solutions GmbH](https://www.northdata.de/LG-LHT+Passenger+Solutions+GmbH,+Hamburg/HRB+157216) a small concern of [Lufthansa Technik](https://www.lufthansa-technik.com/en) and [LG Electronics](https://www.lg.com/de/).

My daily activities at work involve building interesting softwares and platforms to make the flights more enjoyable for passengers.

On my personal time, I like to 

- read books 
- watch histrical documentries(though forget most of the things üòì)
