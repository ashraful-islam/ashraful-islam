# Hello, I am Ashraful Islam!

Originally from [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh) 🇧🇩, I am currently living in the beautiful port city [Hamburg](https://hamburg.de) in Germany 🇩🇪.

After completing my Bachelor of Science, I had decided to move to Germany to pursue my Master of Science in late 2015.
