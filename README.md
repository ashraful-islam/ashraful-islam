I am [Ashraful Islam](https://github.com/ashraful-islam), a [Software Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) based in Hamburg, Germany(locally known as Deutschland). My origin is South Asia, in the little beautiful green country, Bangladesh.

### Meaning Of Life

The meaning of life is apparently [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy). Other than that, to me meaning of life is to make the world a better place and enjoy the adventure while doing it.
