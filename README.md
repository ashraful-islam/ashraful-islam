Some of the common tools of trade I use freqently are [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Python](https://python.org), [Go](https://golang.org).

### Meaning Of Life

The meaning of life is apparently [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy). Other than that, to me meaning of life is to make the world a better place and enjoy the adventure while doing it.
